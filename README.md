# Data-Driven-Music-Recommendation-System

Python, File I/O, User Profiles

Implemented persistent user data handling with file I/O operations, parsing, and updating a structured text database of users and their favorite artists. 

Designed logic to identify users with the highest overlap in musical taste and generate tailored recommendations. Features include user registration, preference updating, detection of the most popular artists, and friend-based recommendations with popularity metrics.
